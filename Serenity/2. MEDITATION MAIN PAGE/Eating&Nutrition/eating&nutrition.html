    <section class="one">
        <span class="big">Foods</span> that contain complex carbohydrates, such as brown rice, whole wheat pasta, beans, broccoli, and cabbage take more time for the body to process than simple carbohydrates like sugar, and will lead to fewer ups and downs in serotonin levels in the brain, and may help you feel calmer.
        <br> <br>
        It is not about what our bromidic tradition tells us to eat. It is basically about what we eat and how much its intake is. Some might need high while some might need low. We need to have proper knowledge of food as partial one is also harmful. Eating healthy definitely helps you calm your mind but can also be a means for that one difference and effort needed to make your living better.
        <br> <br>

        Here are some of the ways by which you can improve your eating routine:

        <ol>
            <li><u>Eat small in different intervals</u></li>
            <p class="underline">If you are at a thought that skipping meals will help you somehow, you might like to know that by doing so your blood sugar levels drop and you may feel irritable, jittery, and have worsened anxiety. You must try aiming at eating 6-7 smaller meals and snacks throughout the day to keep your blood sugar levels from plummeting.</p>

            <li><u>Eat Whole Grains/Good Carbohydrates</u></li>
            <p class="underline">Replacing processed grains (such as white bread and pasta) and simple carbohydrates (such as fruit juices) with complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables would be a really good step you would like to take. Foods that contain complex carbohydrates, such as brown rice, whole wheat pasta, beans, broccoli, and cabbage take more time for the body to process than simple carbohydrates like sugar, and will lead to fewer ups and downs in serotonin levels in the brain, and may help you feel calmer.</p>

            <li><u>Alcohol limitation</u></li>
            <p class="underline">Alcohol as a whole when taken in limited amount is not at all harmful. It is even seen in many medicines and cures for many diseases. It is harmful when you get addicted to it and make it a daily routine. This may aggravate feelings of depression (which often coincide with social anxiety).</p>

            <li><u>Avoid Refined Sugar</u></li>
            <p class="underline">Refined sugar, found in sweets, soda pop, and other foods, can affect your body's metabolism and deplete certain vitamins and minerals. Stay away from obvious sugar sources as well as hidden sugar in packaged and canned foods. It is also helpful in not having your weight gained and having a more peaceful mind.</p>

            <li><u>Avoiding Caffeine</u></li>
            <p class="underline">Everyone is known to a fact that caffeine is something which is found in coffee and it makes sleep and laziness to go away for a while. I always wondered if it was some sort of magic, and everything which makes an easy and quick effort has its own drawbacks. After some google search, I got to know that even limited coffee can show a bad effect. Caffeine can cause an effect similar to stress due to which it is best if avoided. Not only does coffee contain caffeine, it can also be seen in tea, soda pop, chocolate and some medications. You can replace it with herbal teas like chamomile which lacks caffeine which does not have any side effects. </p>

            <li><u>Beware of artificial sweetener</u></li>
            <p class="underline">Although it might be tempting to use artificial sweeteners in place of refined sugars, be sure that consumption of these products is not aggravating your social anxiety. If you find yourself feeling particularly anxious after consuming an artificial sweetener, it might be wise to avoid that product. Always know that you will only be shown the sweetness of the sweetener not the effects it makes upon you.</p>

            <li><u>Water Intake</u></li>
            <p class="underline">Water being the basic need of living, is very underrated. It is available to almost everyone and you should use it wisely. Though water has long been touted as an anxiety-reliever. Drinking water, no doubt has many benefits like keeping your body hydrated and avoiding dehydration that can lead to lower energy levels which can worsen anxiety. It will also help you reduce weight in a healthy and permanent way which will make you build up your confidence level.</p>

            <li><u>Omega-3 Fatty Acids</u></li>
            <p class="underline">Include omega-3 fatty acids and if already having intake of it then increase its intake. In order to do so, you can eat nuts, seeds, and cold-water fish. It can also be found in coconut oil and particularly flax seeds.</p>

            <li><u>Take a Multi-Vitamin</u></li>
            <p class="underline">Ensure that you receive adequate daily vitamins and minerals by supplementing your diet with a multi-vitamin. Magnesium is a particularly important mineral and can also be found in foods such as nuts (e.g., almonds and cashews), soybeans, and spinach.</p>

            <li><u>Probiotics Intake</u></li>
            <p class="underline">The intestine and gut bacteria release hormones like serotonin that are prominent in influencing the mood. So, if you eat probiotic-rich food, it will have a calming effect on the brain. Yoghurt contains probiotics, which may have a positive effect on brain health and anxiety levels. </p>

            <li><u>Anti-oxidants</u></li>
            <p class="underline"> Any food that is loaded with antioxidants is a superfood. Dark chocolate and turmeric milk, since milk has vitamin D and turmeric has curcumin with anti-inflammatory properties, together will have a calming effect as these contain anti-oxidants, suggests Dhivya, Senior Dietician, Fortis Hospital, Bangalore.  Incorporating anti-oxidant rich food like berries, citrus food, and Vitamin C and E-rich foods like nuts pumpkin, watermelon, and flax seeds, as it supports brain functioning and protects against brain oxidative stress.</p>

            <li><u>Vitamin-B</u></li>
            <p class="underline">Studies have shown a positive effect of Vitamin B on the nervous system. In fact, all Vitamin B rich food like fish, eggs, and vegetables help reduce anxiety.</p>

            <li><u>Help from Magnesium</u></li>
            <p class="underline">Magnesium can help stave off the symptoms of anxiety as it is known as a calming mineral that has been found to induce relaxation. Inadequate magnesium levels may reduce levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Magnesium may also act as a blood brain barrier to prevent the entrance of stress hormones in the brain. Include foods like green vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds and avocado.</p>

            <li><u>Load up on tryptophan</u></li>
            <p class="underline">Tryptophan is known to induce relaxed sleep. It is an amino acid, with which it the body produces neurotransmitter serotonin that further helps regulate sleep and moods. Tryptophan is available in most protein rich foods that may include meats, nuts, seeds, beans, eggs, et al.</p>
            </ol>

            It is completely understandable as giving up on a daily practice is not easy, but all that matters is dedication and efforts. Do not give up as result may take time to get visible but when they are seen they will give you immense satisfaction which will be worth it. Don’t rush in making everything changed at once. It will only have an amazing temporary effect which when returns back to your old habits, which it will in not so long time, can even make conditions worse than original.

            <h2>WHY NUTRITION NOW?</h2>
            <br>
            After discussing so much about food, why do need to know about nutrition now? This might be revolving in many of your brains. Basically, it is not enough to just improve your eating habits but also taking proper nutrition alongside. Some daily meal taken for example, imagine your health if you are eating only fruits but in proper intervals or only vegetables and chapatis in the same manner. None of this will help you.
            <br><br>
            Nutrition studies the interaction between nutritious foods and the maintenance, growth, reproduction, health and disease of organisms. The nutrition for better life category covers the Sustainable Development Goals of no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being as well as responsible consumption and production.
            <br><br>
            Eating enough nutrition is really vital for optimal health. Particularly I would like to focus on well-known nutrient, Protein. This is mainly important for weight loss. High protein intake can boost metabolism significantly while making you feel full enough to automatically eat fewer calories. It can also reduce cravings and your desire to snack late at night. Sufficient protein intake has also been shown to lower blood sugar and blood pressure levels.
            <br><br>
            If you’ve ever read the ingredient list on a protein supplement such as a protein bar, you’ve likely seen the term <b>“milk protein isolate.”</b> Milk protein isolate contains a blend of casein and whey proteins in a ratio similar to the ratio found in cow’s milk. Milk protein isolate is a protein product derived from skim milk powder. Milk protein isolate has a healthy nutritional profile, which means it could be an excellent addition to your diet. Having looked down at the breakdown of the nutrition of milk protein isolate per standard 1-ounce (30-gram) scoop, we see that it contains 110 calories, 25 grams protein, 1-gram fat and less than 1-gram carbohydrate.
            <br><br>
            Milk protein isolate is an excellent source of protein and contains all the essential amino acids your body needs. It’s also a good source of branched-chain amino acids, such as leucine, which are important for muscle growth and recovery.
            <br><br>
            <b>Sprouted nuts</b> are raw nuts that have been soaked in water to germinate, or begin to sprout. Because sprouted grains are popular, you may be wondering whether sprouted nuts are also good for your health. Sprouted nuts are untreated raw nuts that have been soaked overnight, if not fully sprouted. Most commercial nuts you eat are not sprouted and have likely been roasted or seasoned in some way. Research indicates that sprouting certain grains and legumes can boost their antioxidants, amino acids, and B vitamins. It’s also been shown to reduce antinutrients like phytic acid, which can inhibit the absorption of other important vitamins and minerals.
            <br><br>
            A 28-gram (1/4-cup) serving of sprouted walnuts has 180 calories, 16 grams total fat, 6 grams protein, 4 grams total carbs, 2 grams fiber, 1-gram sugar, 2% of the DV calcium and 4% of the DV Iron. Research on grains and legumes indicates that sprouting improves nutritional quality. However, research on sprouted versus raw nuts shows no significant difference in nutrient or phytate content. Most of the nuts you find in their raw or roasted form can also be sprouted or at least can go through the soaking step of sprouting. You may be able to find these nuts online or in certain stores.
            <br><br>
            In conclusion, just take care of eating habits and nutrition simultaneously. No one can stop you from making a positive difference in your life then by making it better. Good nutrition doesn’t come in a pill. Try eating a variety of foods instead. Your body benefits most from healthy whole foods. Only take vitamins that your doctor prescribes.
