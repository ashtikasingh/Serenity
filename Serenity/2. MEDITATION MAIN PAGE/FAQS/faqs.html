        <div id="panel">Click on the question you want answer for...</div>
    </section>

    <section class="one">
    <div id="flip1">How do I know if I’m meditating the right way?</div>
    <div id="panel1">This question reflects the goal-oriented perfectionist in you who monitors your activities to make sure you’re doing them right. The great thing about meditation is that you can’t do it wrong, short of not doing it at all. (In fact, it’s the perfectionist that causes most of your stress. And the point of meditation is to reduce stress, not intensify it.)</div>
    </section>

    <section class="two">
    <div id="flip2">What should I do if I keep falling asleep while I meditate?</div>
    <div id="panel2">Like restlessness, sleepiness is a common roadblock on the journey of meditation. First, you may want to explore the sleepiness a little. Where do you experience it in your body? Is it just mental dullness, or are you physically tired as well? Perhaps you should be napping rather than meditating!</div>
    </section>

    <section class="three">
    <div id="flip3">How can I find the time to meditate in my busy schedule?</div>
    <div id="panel3">Well, the great thing about meditation is that it doesn’t really take all that much time. As soon as you pick up the basics, you can begin by practicing for five or ten minutes each day. Mornings are generally best, at least to start.</div>
    </section>

    <section class="four">
        <div id="flip4">What should I do about the restlessness or discomfort I experience while meditating?</div>
        <div id="panel4">You may find it comforting to realize that you’re not alone if you feel restless or uncomfortable when meditating. Everyone experiences agitation or discomfort in his or her meditation from time to time (or even often). In fact, meditation acts like a mirror that reflects you back to you. Believe it or not, that’s one of its virtues. When you stop your busy life for a few minutes and sit quietly, you may suddenly notice the nervous energy and frenzied thinking that have been stressing you out. Welcome to the world of meditation!</div>
    </section>

    <section class="five">
        <div id="flip5">Will meditation make me too relaxed or spaced out to succeed at work or school?</div>
        <div id="panel5">In the old days, people used to associate meditation with impractical alternative lifestyles, and they feared they might morph into a laid-back hippie or navel-gazing yogi if they dared to sit quietly for a few minutes. Fortunately, times have changed, and everywhere you look you can find articles touting the scientifically proven benefits of meditation. The fact is that meditation teaches you how to focus your mind and minimize distractions so you can actually get things done more effectively.</div>
    </section>

    <section class="six">
        <div id="flip6">Can I meditate in a chair or lying down instead of cross-legged on the floor?</div>
        <div id="panel6">Yes. you can meditate in many different positions. Traditional meditation postures include sitting, standing, walking, lying down, and moving in particular patterns. Basically, any position that you can comfortably sustain is appropriate for meditation.<br>
            <br>
            Of course, lying down has its downside: You’re more likely to fall asleep. So you may have to make a special effort to stay alert and focused. One helpful technique is to keep your knees bent while you meditate.<br>
            <br>
            More important than whether you sit, lie, or stand for meditation is what you do with your back. Slumping forward or tilting to the side so your body fights against gravity may eventually prove painful and make it difficult to sustain your practice over weeks and months.</div>
        </section>

    <section class="seven">
        <div id="flip7">Can I meditate while I’m driving my car or sitting at my computer?</div>
        <div id="panel7">Although you can’t practice formal meditation while you’re engaged in ordinary activities, you can practice doing things meditatively. During your daily periods of silent meditation, you discover how to stay present as much as possible amidst the welter of distracting thoughts, emotions, and sensations. Then, when you slip behind the wheel of your car or sit down in front of your computer, you can apply at least some of the same mindful, attentive presence to negotiate rush-hour traffic or prepare a report.
            <br> <br>
            You’ll find that you accomplish the activity with less effort and strain and enjoy yourself more.</div>
    </section>

    <section class="eight">
        <div id="flip8">Do I have to give up my religious beliefs to meditate?</div>
        <div id="panel8">Definitely not. You can apply the basic principles and techniques of meditation to any spiritual or religious tradition or orientation. In fact, many people find that meditation methods with Eastern roots actually deepen their connection to their own Western faith by supplementing prayer and belief with some direct experience of the love and presence of God.</div>
